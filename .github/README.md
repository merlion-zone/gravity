Customized Gravity module and cli for Merlion blockchain.

Gravity is the cross-chain infra between Cosmos SDK based chain and EVM compatible chain, focused on maximum design
simplicity and efficiency.

The original Gravity is implemented and maintained by [Gravity-Bridge](https://github.com/Gravity-Bridge/Gravity-Bridge).
This forked repo added the `multigravity` module which allows establishing cross-chain channels to multiple EVM chains.

## Status
